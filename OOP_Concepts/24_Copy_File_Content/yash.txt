# Copying File Content

## Concept
Copying the content of one file to another involves:
1. Opening the source file in **read mode** (`ifstream`).
2. Opening the destination file in **write mode** (`ofstream`).
3. Reading character by character (or line by line) from the source and writing it to the destination.
4. Closing both files.

## Functions Used
- `get()`: Read a single character.
- `put()`: Write a single character.
- `eof()`: Check for end of file.
