# Hierarchical Inheritance

## Concept
**Hierarchical Inheritance** is a type of inheritance where multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

## Structure
```
      Base Class
      /       \
Derived1    Derived2
```

## Syntax
```cpp
class Base { ... };
class Derived1 : public Base { ... };
class Derived2 : public Base { ... };
```
